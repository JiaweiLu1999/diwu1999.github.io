description: 'The "Emotion Lab after COVID-19" project uses interactive exhibition spaces to create a disorienting, confusing, and complex spatial atmosphere under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The exhibition space collects the emotional experiences of the people around the site under the influence of the epidemic and uses a combination of art and technology to materialize the "invisible‚Äù emotions. It creates an Emotion Lab after COVID-19 that integrates the display, the experience, and the perception of emotions, thus preserving and emphasizing both the individual and collective memories of the epidemic. The Emotion Lab is an exhibition space during the daytime. The cafe in it transforms into a bar at night, providing the public with a space for relaxation and communication, to collect emotions in space.'
