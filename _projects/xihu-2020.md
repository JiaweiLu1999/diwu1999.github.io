description:  This is a group project to reshape the West Lake waterfront leisure space and connect the urban pedestrian system with the theme of ecological restoration as well as preservation of history. The project hopes to re-establish the connection between the city's veins (pedestrian paths) and arteries (water) and to enhance the vitality of the site. Using "water" as the narrative element, the design incorporates five scenes from history and culture, attempting to evoke everyone's memories of West Lake and Hangzhou, and reflecting a microcosm of the changing relationship between water and the city.
