description:  This poster design is for Eli Klein Gallery Exhibition “Detour”, Artist Xiao Kegang’s first solo exhibition in the US. In “Detour,” life’s most unanticipated occurrences have guided the artist’s painting and his incorporation of setbacks have created a visually distinct artistry. “Detour” consists of 19 paintings on a variety of scales, ranging from 16 inches to 10 feet, “detouring” through the totality of the artist’s recent experiments in painting.
