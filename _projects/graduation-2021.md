description: '"Roof Mosaic: Renovation of the Urban Village in Gaoqiao Town, Shanghai" is the graduation project that I completed in collaboration with three of my classmates in the undergraduate program.  In the initial research part of the project, we constructed a set of analysis frameworks from four dimensions (Relationships with its Surroundings, Typo-morphology, Disaster & Infrastructure, Public Space and Activities) to find the features of the site and explore the problems of it. In the design process, we found that there is a set of spontaneously organic patterns in the urban villages, making it possible for them to "grow‚Äù continuously. Therefore, with full respect for this space, the design abandoned the large-scale demolition and renovation method, and set up four kinds of modules: "Water Storage Module", "Economic Module", "Rest Module" and "Planting Module" on the roof space, to revive the vitality of this site.'
