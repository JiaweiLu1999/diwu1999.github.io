description:  This is a group project. The project intends to discard and renovate the old facilities and layout of Hangzhou Youth Activity Center, and create an open-air experimental space with the theme of experimentation, interaction and learning from children's perspective. Using the cube as the design unit and stacking as the interaction method, it forms variable three-dimensional structures, thus activating this barren space into a real place for children to get in touch with nature and enjoy city life.
